Install and configure a two node couchbase cluster using Vagrant and Chef.

### Dependencies apart from required ones ###

chef-couchbase cookbook that allow adding a node to cluster. Source: https://github.com/dwashko/chef-couchbase
vagrant-ohai cookbook modified from the original one to specify eth1 as the node['ipaddress'] instead of eth0. Source: https://github.com/tknerr/cookbooks-vagrant-ohai
Every couchbase dependant cookbook included.

### Details ##

Vagrantfile created to generate multi vms, using chef solo for provisioning.
Cookbook "couchbasenode" created to configure master node and secondary-n ones.
Used CouchBase 4.0.0
Used Chef 12.10.24
Forwarded ports for testing, so cluster can be accessed via localhost:8091 or the assigned ip address (192.168.10.10 and 192.168.10.11) :8091
Default admin username is administrator, password is 1mn0td3f4ult . Both specified on couchbasenode attributes file.
Bucket created name is "first" which has a password that is "lm1815"

### Run instructions ###

cd couchbasecluster
vagrant up

### Workarounds ###

- Had to avoid using latest chef version, it has a bug using it on vagrant, details on https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/4948
- Had to use the modified vagrant-ohai cookbook, so every call to node['ipaddress'] on couchbase recipe used the correct one.
- Forwarded ports for testing, so cluster can be accessed via localhost:8091 or the assigned ip address (192.168.10.10 and 192.168.10.11) :8091
